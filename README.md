# Epomaker EP84 - Custom RGB Lightning / PoC for OpenRGB implementation

## Features
Support for:
- every lightning mode and per-mode option supported by the official EPOMAKER application
- different speed and brightness settings
- "dazzle" (rainbow coloring) mode
- support for User Picture mode, along with an experimental (!) bitmap to colors-layout conversion

## Credits
Very largely inspired from [Perroboc](https://gitlab.com/perroboc/OpenRGB)'s work on the EPTH80. File `ep84.py` is an enriched version of their work, while User Picture mode (`user_picture.py`) was entirely reverse engineered by me.
